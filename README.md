###Automated Test
-------
To create automated test cases, one can utilize XCode’s built-in application Instruments. This application

has an Automation tool that can be used to create user gestures to ensure proper user interface. This 

tool interprets commands in Javascript format, and there is a recording tool as well as tutorials 

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvm8DyR6fLE) to help the user get familiar with UI Tests. For 

BoundBreaker, a template was created that must be placed under the traces directory. The easiest way 

to access said directory is to initialize the Automation tool and record a gesture; the default directory 

prompt is the desired directory. The file named Game.tracetemplate found under the 

BoundBreakerTests’s directory must be placed in this directory. One can then edited and/or run the 

automated tests.
